# unit-cube

A minimal Typst template for prose.

Code is MIT No Attribution.

## Installation

Just throw `template.typ` into your project, I don't want to bother with the Typst universe when releasing something so small. It's pretty much a feature subset slash refactor of https://github.com/shunichironomura/iac-typst-template, anyways.

## Naming

I wanted to be quirky. In the survival game Rust, one of the first things you might do is create a little box to live in. A player has done this a thousand times before, no need to think about it. I use this library when I just want to format something nicely without needing to put any thought in. Also, the idea of the unit cube generally being a default option fits as well.
