## Naming

I wanted to be quirky. In the survival game Rust, one of the first things you might do is create a little box to live in. A player has done this a thousand times before, no need to think about it. This is a collection of stuff I use when I just want to format something nicely without needing to put any thought in. Also, the idea of the unit cube generally being a default option fits as well.
